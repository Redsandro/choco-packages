		<summary>A complete disaster recovery solution for your home system.</summary>
		<description>
A __free disaster recovery__ solution for your __home computer.__

__Protect__ your personal files. __Clone your harddisk__ and __create disk images__ in the safe knowledge that everything is __securely saved__ in an __easily recovered__ backup.

### This package is broken. Not silent.

I had this package offline until I found the time to fix the CNET downloader. Once I did and I pushed this, I found that _Reflect_ now downloads a __downloader__ which can download any _Reflect_ version.

__I am looking for a maintainer with AutoIT skills or something similar to fix the new Macrium downloader to auto-download the free version and install that one.__

__Bug fixes__

* The error "Bad file descriptor" could cause a clone to fail. This has been resolved.
* Free and Standard editions. The error message "Dynamic Disks are not supported" could incorrectly be displayed when editing an XML file. This has been resolved.
* If the source driver files are marked as 'Read Only' this could cause a copy failure when building the Windows PE rescue media. This has been resolved.
* Improved support for Linux systems using Grub 2
