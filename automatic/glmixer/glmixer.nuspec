    <description>
GLMixer performs in real time the graphical blending of several movie clips. Typically, you load a set of video samples, and decide on the fly how much they should be visible, arrange the images in the screen, and which effects you apply to them.

The principle of interaction is to drop video files into a workspace, and to move them in a circular area to change their opacity ; if you selects two videos, moving them together makes a fading transition. This principle is generalized to any number of videos. Direct interaction with the video allows to be fast and reactive, and to move and deform them on screen.

The output of your operations is shown in the output window, which should typically be displayed full-screen on an external monitor or a projector, or can be saved as a video file.
