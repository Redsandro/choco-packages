		<summary>KeePassX is an application for people with extremly high demands on secure personal data management. It has a light interface, is cross platform and published under the terms of the GNU General Public License.</summary>
		<description>
**KeePassX** saves many different information e.g. user names, passwords, urls, attachments and comments in one single database. For a better management user-defined titles and icons can be specified for each single entry. Furthermore the entries are sorted in groups, which are customizable as well.

The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).

Originally KeePassX was called KeePass/L for Linux since it was a port of Windows password manager Keepass Password Safe. After KeePass/L became a cross platform application the name was not appropriate anymore and therefore, on 22 March 2006 it has been changed.

What version of KeePass should I use?
---

* If you are a Windows-only user and will be forever, use the most up-to-date `keepass` *KeePass Password Safe* 2.x.
* If you come from **Linux** or **OSX** using *"KeePassX",* and/or want to share your password database between multiple operating systems, use `keepass-classic` *KeePass Classic,* which database is binary-compatible. KeePass Classic is written in `Mono`.
* See previous point, but if you want to have the *exact same program,* use `keepassx` *KeePassX Password Safe*. The Windows version uses the `Qt` library and has a heavier footprint. Using *KeePass Classic* is recommended.
