		<summary>Tixati is a cross-platform BitTorrent client written in C++ that has been designed to be light on system resources.</summary>
		<description>
__Tixati__ is one of the most advanced and flexible BitTorrent clients available.  And unlike many other clients, Tixati contains _NO SPYWARE, NO ADS,_ and _NO GIMMICKS._

__Tixati__ has the following features:  

* detailed views of all aspects of the swarm, including peers, pieces, files, and trackers
* support for magnet links, so no need to download .torrent files if a simple magnet-link is available
* super-efficient peer choking/unchoking algorithms ensure the fastest downloads
* peer connection encryption for added security
* full DHT (Distributed Hash Table) implementation for trackerless torrents, including detailed message traffic graphs and customizable event logging
* advanced bandwidth charting of overall traffic and per-transfer traffic, with separate classification of protocol and file bytes, and with separate classification of outbound traffic for trading and seeding
* highly flexible bandwidth throttling, including trading/seeding proportion adjustment and adjustable priority for individual transfers and peers
* bitfield graphs that show the completeness of all downloaded files, what pieces other peers have available, and the health of the overall swarm
* customizable event logging for each download, and individual event logs for all peers within the swarm
* expert local file management functions which allow you to move files to a different partition even while downloading is still in progress
* 100% compatible with the BitTorrent protocol
* Windows and Linux-GTK native versions available
